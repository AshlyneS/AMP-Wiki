With your permission, AMP can send CubeCoders some anonymous usage data. We use this to help us understand how AMP is being used.

The information collected is as follows:

 * The operating system name and version (E.g. Debian 10)
 * The system architecture (x86/64 or aarch64)
 * How many instances are configured for each game type (E.g. Minecraft x2, Valheim x1, Factorio x3)
 * Which mode AMP is configured in (Standalone, controller, target, hybrid)
 * The CPU name and model, along with the number of cores and threads
 * The amount of installed RAM
 * The type of virtualization being used (if any)
 * On Linux, whether or not Docker is installed and if AMP is using it.

This data is collected no more frequently than once every 3 months.

This information is at the ADS level and doesn't affect individual instances.
