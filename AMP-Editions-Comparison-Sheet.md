# About AMP Editions

## Professional

AMP Professional Edition is the recommended licence for users self-hosting a small number (Typically less than 10) of game servers on their own hardware. Each licence allows 5 AMP instances, and these licences stack automatically. So if you either purchase two at once or purchase two separate licences on different occasions you'll have a single licence key good for 10 instances.

The licence for Professional Edition prohibits commercial usage of AMP itself. You can still accept financial contributions or monetise your players (in line with the EULA of the respective game servers being used) - but you may not act as a server host, accepting money to host servers and allowing users to access AMP as a means of managing them.

## Network

The two Network Editions are bulk licencing for enthusiasts and medium/large game server network operators. They have a higher initial limit, and also allow users to create up to 10 game servers instances to which they may give friends or family direct access (So long as they are not being charged for this)

Both network editions expressly prohibit commercial usage of AMP itself. You can still accept financial contributions or monetise your players (in line with the EULA of the respective game servers being used) - but you may not act as a server host, accepting money to host servers and allowing users to access AMP as a means of managing them.

### Standard

Network Standard Licences have a 50 instance limit, and are a one-time cost. Like AMP Professional, these licences can be stacked - however we may impose a limit on how many may be purchased by a single person.

### Premium

Premium Licences require an ongoing monthly subscription and remain valid only so long as that subscription is paid up (with a small grace period to allow for billing issues/delays to be resolved). These licences are technically unlimited in how many instances may be created, *however they ship with a 50 instance limit as standard. This can be increased on-demand by contacting CubeCoders. The limitation and requirement for contact is to help protect against licence abuse and to discourage attempts to use it commercially against the licence terms.

## [Patreon](https://patreon.com/cubecoders)

These licences are issued to backers of our [Patreon campaign](https://patreon.com/cubecoders). They become permanent after 6 months of backing. Functionally they are similar to the Network Editions, but don't include Friends/Family instances. These licences also come with other perks such as the ability to vote in additional votes/polls that determine AMPs future and access backer-only sections of the CubeCoders Discord.

## Enterprise

Enterprise Edition is for hosting companies who wish to sell Game Servers with AMP pre-installed and allow users access to those game server instances via AMPs web interface. The cost of this varies depending on the number of game server instances. It may be distributed amongst any number of machines, and there is no difference in pricing for controller/target nodes - the only metric affecting the cost is the number of game server instances you wish to be able to host at a single time. These licences may be upgraded on-demand, or downgraded the day after the next billing cycle (i.e. if you wish to downgrade, you will always pay one additional month of the current price, with the new price and instance limit taking effect the month after)

## Black

Black edition is made available by invitation only to existing users who have made significant contributions to the AMP community. It is functionally the same as AMP Network Standard, but does not require an additional developer licence to be added to load unsigned development plugins/modules.

## Platinum

Platinum edition is a high cost licence made available by invitation only to existing high-usage, high-profile users. It is equivalent to Enterprise Edition but has no monthly cost after the initial membership fee.

## Developer

Developer licences are added on as a secondary licence to an instance licenced with any other licence type. These licences allow the instance to load and run unsigned modules/plugins during development. These are currently freely available to all users who have any kind of paid AMP licence.
