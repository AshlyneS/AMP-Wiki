Sharing your generic module configurations allows other users to enjoy running the same application within AMP.

We're interested in sharing templates for games or applications for which AMP doesn't already have a dedicated module, or for which no generic template has already been made. For the first 10 accepted templates we're offering up 2 AMP instances 
as a small reward for those users.

If the application supports both Windows and Linux, your configuration should be tested and verified to work on both platforms. Templates that require any hard-coded port numbers will not be accepted.

You can test the existing module configurations by creating a Generic instance, and then copying their data inside your GenericModule.kvp file for that instance.

If you've produced your own module configuration, you can contribute in one of two ways:

# By pull-request (preferred method)

To do this, clone the CubeCoders/AMP repository and then check out your clone. Once you've done that you can produce a new file in GenericModuleTemplates containing your GenericModule.kvp configuration and then push the changes. Once you've done that you can submit a pull request via GitHub which we will then review.

# By creating an issue

If you're unfamiliar with Git, you can create an issue containing your configuration as its contents and we will merge in the contents for you after reviewing them.
